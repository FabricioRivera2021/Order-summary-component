## My process

Similar to the last chalenge of frontendmentor (the nft card), this time i tried to use relative units and have a better structure overall.

### Built with

- html
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

To have a better structured process, i did first the html markup, then i went from top to bottom making the hole card.

### Continued development

I will continue leveling up my skills with this fun challenges.
